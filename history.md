# FreeSnow — Implementation History

A chronological log of all implementation work, decisions, and changes made during the build of FreeSnow.

---

## Phase 1: Project Initialization

### Scaffolding
- Created a Vite 6 + React 19 + TypeScript 5.7 project using Bun 1.3.9
- Installed dependencies: `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom@7`, `recharts`, `date-fns@4`, `vite-plugin-pwa`, `workbox-*`
- Configured path alias `@/*` → `src/*` in `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`
- Set up PWA manifest and service worker (StaleWhileRevalidate caching via Workbox)
- Created dark theme CSS with custom properties (`--color-bg: #0f172a`, `--color-surface: #1e293b`, `--color-accent: #38bdf8`, etc.)

### Data Layer
- Defined all TypeScript interfaces in `src/types.ts`: `Resort`, `HourlyMetrics`, `DailyMetrics`, `BandForecast`, `ResortForecast`, `ElevationBand`
- Built `src/data/openmeteo.ts` with `fetchForecast()` and `fetchHistorical()` — both hit Open-Meteo's free API (no key needed)
- Created `src/data/resorts.ts` with 31 curated North American ski resorts (CO, UT, CA, MT, WY, VT, NH, WA, OR, BC, AB) including coordinates, elevations, vertical drop, lifts, and acres
- Built `src/data/favorites.ts` for localStorage-based favorites management
- Created `src/hooks/useWeather.ts` (`useForecast`, `useHistorical`) and `src/hooks/useFavorites.ts`

### Utility Layer
- `src/utils/weather.ts`: Unit conversion functions (`fmtTemp`, `fmtElevation`, `fmtSnow`, `cmToIn`) and WMO weather code → emoji + label mapping (`weatherDescription`)

---

## Phase 2: Core UI

### App Shell & Routing
- `src/main.tsx`: Entry point wrapping App in providers and `BrowserRouter`
- `src/App.tsx`: Routes — `/` → HomePage, `/resort/:slug` → ResortPage
- `src/components/Layout.tsx`: App layout with `<Outlet>`, footer with Open-Meteo attribution

### Home Page (`src/pages/HomePage.tsx`)
- Search bar filtering resorts by name
- Resorts grouped by region (state/province)
- Resort cards (`src/components/ResortCard.tsx`) with name, region, elevation, favorite toggle

### Resort Detail Page (`src/pages/ResortPage.tsx`)
- Header with resort name, region, website link, favorite star
- Quick stats row (base/mid/top elevation, vertical drop, lifts, acres)
- Elevation band toggle (`src/components/ElevationToggle.tsx`) — Base/Mid/Top segmented control
- 7-day forecast day cards (weather icon, high/low, snowfall)
- Refresh button

### Chart Components
- `DailyForecastChart.tsx` — ComposedChart: snow + rain bars with high/low/feels-like temperature lines, dual Y-axes
- `HourlyDetailChart.tsx` — ComposedChart: hourly snow + rain + temp + feels-like (72 hours)
- `UVIndexChart.tsx` — BarChart with Cell-based per-bar coloring by UV severity level
- `FreezingLevelChart.tsx` — AreaChart showing freezing altitude over time
- `SnowHistoryChart.tsx` — Historical snowfall by month (multi-season)

---

## Phase 3: Favorites Redesign

### Removed Dedicated Favorites Tab
- Originally had a separate `/favorites` route — removed it
- Favorites section now displayed inline at the top of the Home Page

### FavoriteCard Component (`src/components/FavoriteCard.tsx`)
- Richer card showing forecast summary for favorited resorts
- Displays next 3 days: snowfall + high/low temps
- Clickable — navigates to resort detail page
- Fetches its own forecast data on mount

### Bug Fixes
- **Archive API lag**: Open-Meteo archive endpoint has ~5 day delay for recent data. Switched recent snowfall to use the forecast endpoint's `past_days` parameter instead.
- **Variable name collision**: `snow` from `useUnits()` conflicted with snowfall value variable in `RecentSnowTable` → renamed to `snowUnit`.
- **Toggle name collision**: `toggle` from `useFavorites()` conflicted in ResortPage → renamed to `toggleFav`.

---

## Phase 4: Imperial / Metric Toggle

### UnitsContext (`src/context/UnitsContext.tsx`)
- Created `UnitSystem` type: `'imperial' | 'metric'`
- Context provides: `{ units, toggle, temp, elev, snow }` (derived display units)
- Persisted to localStorage key `freesnow_units`
- Wired through all components and chart components

### Floating FAB Button
- Added to `Layout.tsx` as a fixed-position pill button in the top-right corner
- Shows current units (e.g., `°F / ft` or `°C / m`)
- Click toggles between imperial and metric

---

## Phase 5: Header Banner Removal

- Removed the static header/banner component
- Units FAB now floats freely at the top-right as a fixed-position element
- Cleaner look — no wasted vertical space

---

## Phase 6: Timezone Support

### TimezoneContext (`src/context/TimezoneContext.tsx`)
- `TZ_OPTIONS` array: 13 curated North American timezones + UTC
- Each option has IANA key, display label, and reference city
- `getUtcOffset()` helper computes live UTC offset for any IANA timezone
- Context provides: `{ tz, tzRaw, tzLabel, setTz, fmtDate }`
- `fmtDate` uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with the selected timezone (no date-fns needed for display)
- Persisted to localStorage key `freesnow_tz`

### Timezone Picker UI (Layout.tsx)
- Second FAB button (`🌐 Browser`) in the top-right FAB group
- Click opens a dropdown with:
  - Search input for filtering timezones
  - List of timezone options with UTC offset badges (e.g., `UTC-7`)
  - Click-outside-to-close behavior
- All API calls pass the selected timezone to Open-Meteo
- All date formatting uses the selected timezone

### Unicode Bug Fix
- `\u00b0` and `\ud83c\udf10` escaped sequences in JSX rendered as literal backslash strings
- Replaced with actual `°` and `🌐` characters

---

## Phase 7: Resort Detail Page Redesign

### New Chart Components
- **`HourlySnowChart.tsx`** — Bar chart showing hourly snowfall for a single selected day. Displays total snowfall for the day. Uses recharts BarChart with hour labels.
- **`RecentSnowChart.tsx`** — Past 14-day snowfall visualization using ComposedChart. Shows daily snowfall bars + cumulative total dashed line + faint high/low temperature lines. Dual Y-axes (snow left, temp right).

### Interactive Day Selection
- Added `selectedDayIdx` state to ResortPage (default: 0)
- Day cards are now `<button>` elements — clicking selects a day
- Selected card gets accent border glow (`.day-card--selected`)
- Selected day drives:
  - HourlySnowChart (hourly snow bars for that day)
  - HourlyDetailChart (detailed conditions for that day)
  - FreezingLevelChart (freezing level for that day)

### Reorganized Sections
1. **Snowfall Section** — Section header with 7-day total badge → interactive day cards → 7-Day Overview chart → Hourly Snow breakdown for selected day
2. **Detailed Conditions** — Hourly detail chart for the selected day
3. **Conditions Grid** — UV Index + Freezing Level side-by-side in a responsive 2-column grid
4. **Recent Snowfall** — RecentSnowChart replaces old RecentSnowTable

### CSS Updates
- Added `.day-card--selected` styles (accent border, subtle glow, background tint)
- Added hover/press transition states for day cards
- Added `.section-subtitle` for secondary headings
- Added `.resort-page__conditions-grid` (2-column on desktop, 1-column on mobile ≤768px)
- Added `.resort-page__snow-section-header` with week-total badge
- Removed all `.recent-snow__*` table styles

### Section Reordering (follow-up)
- Moved 7-Day Overview chart to be first thing after day cards
- Hourly Snow breakdown follows the overview
- Hourly detail chart is first in Detailed Conditions section

### Chart Alignment Fix (DailyForecastChart)
- Bars and temperature lines were misaligned due to side-by-side bar grouping shifting individual bars away from tick centers
- Tried `scale="point"` with `padding` — broke bar centering
- Tried `stackId` — made bars too wide and overlapping
- Final solution: `barCategoryGap="15%"` with `maxBarSize={30}` to keep bars centered and appropriately sized

---

## Phase 8: Footer & Open Source Links

- Updated footer text: "open-source" now links to `https://github.com/Ofekw/freesnow`
- Added "Submit Feedback" button linking to `https://github.com/Ofekw/freesnow/issues`
- Styled as an outlined accent pill button that fills on hover

---

## Phase 9: Copilot Workflow Guardrails

- Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to enforce required context loading on every task.
- Instructions now require reading both `#file:history.md` and `#file:plan.md` before decisions or code changes.
- Added a logging rule: when a task introduces a big change, update `#file:history.md` in the same task.
- Goal: keep project context usage consistent and preserve a reliable chronological implementation record.

---

## Phase 10: Fixed Scale Snow Total Graphs

### Consistent Y-Axis Scales for Snow Charts
- **DailyForecastChart**: Fixed precip Y-axis to 0–12 inches with 1-inch increments (imperial) / 0–30 cm with 5 cm increments (metric)
- **HourlyDetailChart**: Fixed precip Y-axis to 0–1 inch with 0.1-inch increments (imperial) / 0–2.5 cm with 0.5 cm increments (metric)
- **HourlySnowChart**: Fixed Y-axis to 0–1 inch with 0.1-inch increments (imperial) / 0–2.5 cm with 0.5 cm increments (metric)
- Previously all three charts used auto-scaling Y-axes, which made comparing snowfall amounts across different days or resorts difficult
- Now all snow total graphs use fixed, consistent scales so users can visually compare snowfall at a glance

### Files Changed
- `src/components/charts/DailyForecastChart.tsx` — added `domain` and `ticks` to precip YAxis
- `src/components/charts/HourlyDetailChart.tsx` — added `domain` and `ticks` to precip YAxis
- `src/components/charts/HourlySnowChart.tsx` — added `domain` and `ticks` to YAxis

## Known Technical Notes

- **Bun PATH**: Must add `$env:PATH = "$env:USERPROFILE\.bun\bin;$env:PATH"` each PowerShell session
- **Open-Meteo archive lag**: ~5 days behind. Use forecast endpoint's `past_days` for recent history.
- **Timezone handling**: All API calls pass the user's selected IANA timezone. All display formatting uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with that timezone.
- **PWA caching**: StaleWhileRevalidate via Workbox — serves cached response immediately, refreshes in background.
